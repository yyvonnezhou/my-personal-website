# Understanding SEC Filings: A Developer's Perspective

As someone coming from a technical background, learning to navigate SEC filings felt like learning a new programming language. Here's my guide to understanding these crucial documents.

## Types of SEC Filings

### 10-K (Annual Report)
The comprehensive annual filing that provides a detailed overview of the company's business and financial condition.

### 10-Q (Quarterly Report)
Quarterly financial statements that provide updates on the company's financial position.

### 8-K (Current Report)
Filed to announce major events or corporate changes.

## Extracting Data Programmatically

The SEC provides an API that makes it possible to fetch filing data programmatically:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK0000320193/us-gaap/Assets.json'
);
const data = await response.json();
```

## Key Sections to Focus On

1. **Business Overview** - Understanding what the company does
2. **Risk Factors** - Potential challenges and threats
3. **Financial Statements** - The numbers that matter
4. **Management Discussion** - Leadership's perspective on performance

## Tools and Resources

- SEC EDGAR database
- XBRL data format for structured financial data
- Python libraries like `sec-edgar-downloader`

Learning to read SEC filings has made me a better analyst and helped me build more effective financial tools.
