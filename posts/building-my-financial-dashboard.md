# Building My Financial Dashboard: Lessons Learned

Creating a financial dashboard that pulls real-time data from SEC filings has been both challenging and rewarding. Here's what I've learned so far.

## The Challenge

I wanted to build a tool that could automatically fetch financial data from company filings and present it in an intuitive, interactive format.

## Technical Stack

After much research, I settled on:
- **Next.js** for the frontend framework
- **SEC Edgar API** for financial data
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## Key Learnings

### 1. Data Quality is Everything
Working with SEC data taught me that cleaning and normalizing financial data is often more complex than building the visualizations themselves.

### 2. API Rate Limits Matter
The SEC Edgar API has reasonable rate limits, but planning for them early in development saved me headaches later.

### 3. User Experience is Critical
Financial data can be overwhelming. Designing clean, intuitive interfaces that don't sacrifice functionality for simplicity was a constant balancing act.

## What's Next

I'm working on adding comparative analysis features and automated report generation. Stay tuned for updates!
