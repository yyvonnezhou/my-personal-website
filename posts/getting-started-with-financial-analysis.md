# Getting Started with Financial Analysis: A Beginner's Guide

Financial analysis can seem daunting at first, but with the right approach and tools, anyone can learn to evaluate companies and make informed investment decisions.

## What is Financial Analysis?

Financial analysis is the process of evaluating businesses, projects, budgets, and other finance-related transactions to determine their performance and suitability for investment.

## Key Financial Statements

### 1. Income Statement
The income statement shows a company's revenues and expenses over a specific period.

### 2. Balance Sheet
The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time.

### 3. Cash Flow Statement
This statement shows how changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents.

## Essential Financial Ratios

- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Compares stock price to earnings per share
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Measures profitability relative to shareholders' equity
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Indicates the relative proportion of debt and equity

## Getting Started

Start by analyzing companies you're familiar with. Practice reading their 10-K and 10-Q filings, which are available for free on the SEC's EDGAR database.
